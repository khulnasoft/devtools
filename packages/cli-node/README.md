# @devtools/cli-node

This library provides utilities for building CLI tools for Devtools.

The difference between this library and `@devtools/cli-common` is that this library is more feature rich with a larger dependency tree, with less concern for bundle size and installation speed. The `@devtools/cli-common` package on the other hand is intended to be extremely slim and only provide minimal features for use in tools like `@devtools/create-app`.
