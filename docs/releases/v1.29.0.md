These are the release notes for the v1.29.0 release of [Devtools](https://devtools.khulnasoft.com/).

A huge thanks to the whole team of maintainers and contributors as well as the amazing Devtools Community for the hard work in getting this release developed and done.

## Highlights

### BREAKING: Backend System deprecations and removals

As part of the [work towards a stable 1.0 release of the new backend system](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devtools/issues/24493), there are several new deprecations and breaking changes in the backend system packages:

**Breaking**:

- The deprecated `token` option has been removed from `PermissionsService`, and the request options are now required and must contain a `credentials` object.
- The deprecated `getPath` option has been removed from `httpRouterServiceFactory`, the plugin paths are now always `/api/<pluginId>`.
- It is no longer possible to pass service factory callbacks to the `defaultServiceFactories` option of `createSpecializedBackend`.

**Deprecations**:

- The ability to define options for service factories through `createServiceFactory` has been deprecated. See the [service architecture documentation](https://devtools.khulnasoft.com/docs/backend-system/architecture/services) for more information on how to define customizable services.
- The ability to install backend features in callback form, i.e. `() => BackendFeature`, has been deprecated. This also includes other usages such as `startTestBackend`, and dynamically imported backend features. No manual changes should be needed for this change, as all backend feature creators have been updated to return `BackendFeature` instances directly.
- The `ServiceFactoryTest.get` method has been renamed to `ServiceFactoryTest.getSubject`, and is now deprecated.
- The following types have been renamed to use an `*Options` suffix instead: `ServiceRefConfig`, `RootServiceFactoryConfig`, `PluginServiceFactoryConfig`.
- Deprecated all exports related to the legacy status checker in `@devtools/backend-common`.
- The `isDockerDisabledForTests` function exported by `@devtools/backend-test-utils` has been deprecated.

### Backend Health Service

A new health service as been added to the new backend system. This service provides health check endpoints for the backend, and replaces `createStatusCheckRouter` from `@devtools/backend-common`.

The service helps implement the new `/.devtools/health/v1/readiness` and `/.devtools/health/v1/liveness` endpoints, which provide health checks for the entire backend instance.

You can read more about this new service and how to customize it in the [Root Health Service documentation](https://devtools.khulnasoft.com/docs/backend-system/core-services/root-health).

### New Catalog Logs module

This new `@devtools/plugin-catalog-backend-module-logs` module is a minimal module that will log any error events that are published by the catalog. This module is useful for making sure that catalog errors are visible in the logs, but you may want to replace it with a more customized solution if the resulting logs are too verbose.

### Updates to the `@devtools/create-app` template

New devtools projects created with `@devtools/create-app` will now include the Catalog Logs module for logging catalog error events, as well as support for the Postgres Search Engine.

### Permission Policy deprecations

The `PermissionPolicy` interface has been updated to align with the recent changes to the Devtools auth system. The second argument to the `handle` method is now of the new `PolicyQueryUser` type. This type maintains the old fields from the `DevtoolsIdentityResponse`, which are now all deprecated. Instead, two new fields have been added, which allows access to the same information:

- `credentials` - A `DevtoolsCredentials` object, which is useful for making requests to other services on behalf of the user as part of evaluating the policy. This replaces the deprecated `token` field. See the [Auth Service documentation](https://devtools.khulnasoft.com/docs/backend-system/core-services/auth#creating-request-tokens) for information about how to create a token using these credentials.
- `info` - A `DevtoolsUserInfo` object, which contains the same information as the deprecated `identity`, except for the `type` field that was redundant.

Most existing policies can be updated by replacing the `DevtoolsIdentityResponse` type with `PolicyQueryUser`, which is exported from `@devtools/plugin-permission-node`, as well as replacing any occurrences of `user?.identity` with `user?.info`.

### Renaming the `setupRequestMockHandlers` test utility

The `setupRequestMockHandlers` utility function exported by `@devtools/test-utils` and `@devtools/backend-test-utils` has been renamed to `registerMswTestHooks`. This is done to better reflect the context and the purpose of the function. The old name is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

### Catalog GitHub module support for `repository` events

The GitHub provider module and `GithubEntityProvider` for the Catalog now supports event driven ingestion of repositories by subscribing to `repository` events from GitHub. This includes the actions `archived`, `deleted`, `edited`, `renamed`, `transferred`, and `unarchived`. This is in addition to the existing support for `push` events, which you can read more about in the integration documentation for [GitHub Discovery](https://devtools.khulnasoft.com/docs/integrations/github/discovery#events-support).

### Catalog i18n support

The Catalog plugin as well as the Catalog React library now support internationalization (i18n). This means that you can customize the messaging in the catalog, as well as add translations. You can read more about this in the [i18n documentation](https://devtools.khulnasoft.com/docs/plugins/internationalization/).

### Route Binding configuration improvements

It is now possible to explicitly remove default route bindings, for cases where you don't want a plugin route to be bound to any target at all:

```yaml
app:
  routes:
    bindings:
      # This has the effect of removing the button for registering new
      # catalog entities in the scaffolder template list view
      scaffolder.registerComponent: false
```

### Scaffolder Fields performance improvements

The `EntityPicker` and `MultiEntityPicker` fields have been updated to improve performance with large catalogs. Contributed by [@kmikko](https://github.com/kmikko) in [#25315](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devtools/pull/25315), [#25380](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devtools/pull/25380)

### BREAKING: Catalog LDAP Module improvements

The `@devtools/plugin-catalog-backend-module-ldap` module has been improved to support multiple or no declarations of both user and group configs.

This change is breaking for `readLdapOrg` and `LdapProviderConfig`, which now both always accept arrays of `users` and `groups` configurations.
