Much like Devtools Open Source, this is a _living_ document! We'll keep this
updated as we evolve our practices!

## üìö Our Philosophy

### Iterative

Devtools Open Source is a newly launched endeavor, and we‚Äôre excited to scale
up our design practices! With that said, we‚Äôll be working closely with you, the
community, and iterating and experimenting as we go to see what works best. As a
continual work in progress, we aspire to release early and often. Not only that,
we are committed to working with developers to create a seamless and easy
handoff. If you‚Äôre curious to see how we grow and would like to play a role in
that growth, check out the issues in this GitHub repo!

### Collaborative

The Devtools Design Team is small but mighty, and we truly cherish the amazing
opportunity we have to work with the Devtools Open Source community! Have an
idea? A component request? Feel free to communicate with us via
[Discord](https://discord.gg/devtools-687207715902193673) (_#design_ channel). Collaboration trumps
individual speed, and we want to work with you to make Devtools work for all of
our users.

### Transparent

There are a lot of exciting things coming up and we want to keep you in the
loop! Keep an eye on our
[Milestones in GitHub](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devtools/milestones) to see
where we're headed and review the
[open design issues](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devtools/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adesign),
to see if you can help. We'll also be posting updates in the _#design_ channel
on [Discord](https://discord.gg/devtools-687207715902193673). Not only that, we want to keep you
informed on the decisions we've made and why we've made them.

## üõ† Our Practice

The chart below details how we work. We have a
[Figma workspace for Devtools Open Source](figma.md), and we plan on
referencing Figma documents to share specs and prototypes with the community.

### Creating a New Design Component

| Step 1                                                                                              | Step 2                                                                             | Step 3                                                                                        | Step 4                                                                     | Step 5                                                                       | Step 6                                                                                 |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Platform design team submits an issue to **khulnasoft/devtools GitHub** with a potential component. | Devtools community offers feedback or approval on **khulnasoft/devtools GitHub**. | Platform design team adjusts accordingly (as they see fit) and update the Figma DLS document. | Designed component is added to **khulnasoft/devtools GitHub** as an issue. | External or internal Devtools open source contributors build the component. | External or internal contributors add the component to the **Devtools Storybook**. üéâ |

### Building for Devtools

| Step 1                                                                                                        | Step 2                                                                                                                      | Step 3                                                                                             | Step 4                                                          |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| External or internal contributors use Devtools and come up with an idea of an entity to build for Devtools. | External or internal contributors refer to the Devtools Open Source design system documentation in the Figma DLS document. | External or internal contributors leverage the components and tokens from the Devtools Storybook. | External or internal contributors build their Devtools entity. |

| Step 5                                                                                                           | Step 6                                                                                                       | Step 7                                                                                                                            | Step 8                                                                                            |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| External or internal contributors make a pull request for their entity on khulnasoft/devtools GitHub for review. | Platform designers and devs review the entity and submit feedback or approval on khulnasoft/devtools GitHub. | External or internal contributors make the changes, pull request is approved and the entity is merged. It‚Äôs live on Devtools! üéâ | If the entity happens to be or include a UX component, it‚Äôs added to Devtools Storybook as well. |

The following diagram shows the relationship between the Devtools Design System
and our foundation, which comprises of [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
that is shaped by user experience and user interface decisions made by our
Devtools Design Team. Also note, we encourage you to take the core experience
we‚Äôve crafted and add custom theming to better represent your organization!

## ‚úÖ Our Priorities

### Devtools Design System

This is the set of building blocks for Devtools contributors to leverage as
they create rad plugins for Devtools! Why reinvent the wheel when you can use
components that have already been vetted by our team and the Devtools
community? In the spirit of crafting a cohesive and consistent user experience
across all of Devtools, we strongly urge all plugin developers to utilize our
Storybook as a reference. Our design system is new and evolving, and we‚Äôll be
building it up with your help!

### Core Devtools User Experience

This is the universal user experience that is shared amongst all Devtools
users. From more concrete aspects like the plugins directory to more abstract
ones like end-to-end workflows on Devtools, we‚Äôll be working with the community
to create a core user experience that best serves you and your organization.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è How to Contribute

### Pick up an issue!

In the beginning, most of our issues will be centered around creating universal
components for our Devtools Design System and adding them to our Storybook so
plugin developers can reference them. We‚Äôll also be creating issues that are
focused on building up our core Devtools user experience. We‚Äôll be labeling our
issues in GitHub with ‚Äòdesign‚Äô and/or ‚Äòstorybook‚Äô - so feel free to browse and
tackle the tasks that interest you. If you have any questions regarding an
issue, you can ask them in the comments section of the issue or on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/devtools-687207715902193673). We absolutely adore our external
contributors and will send you virtual
[semlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semla) for your contributions!

### Request a component

Create an issue (label it design and assign it to katz95) or send us a message
on [Discord](https://discord.gg/devtools-687207715902193673) (_#design_ channel) with details of
what the component is and its relevant use cases. Your request will be reviewed
by our design team and you should hear back from us within 1-2 business days.
We‚Äôll get back to you and let you know whether your requested component will get
picked up by our team as something to be added to our design system.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Resources

**[Storybook](http://devtools.khulnasoft.com/storybook)** - where you can view our
components. If you‚Äôd like to help build up our design system, you can also add
components we‚Äôve designed to the Storybook as well.

**[Figma](https://www.figma.com/@devtools)** - we're stoked to be using Figma
Community to share our design assets. You can duplicate our UI Kit and design
your own plugin for Devtools.

**[Discord](https://discord.gg/devtools-687207715902193673)** - all design questions should be
directed to the _#design_ channel.

**[Customize Devtools's look and feel](https://devtools.khulnasoft.com/docs/getting-started/app-custom-theme)** -
How to customize the look and feel of your Devtools instance by extending the
theme.

## üîÆ Future

### Contributions from designers

Are you a designer at an organisation that‚Äôs implementing Devtools? A designer
who‚Äôs fascinated by the developer productivity problem space? A designer who‚Äôs
curious about open source design? We‚Äôd love for you to contribute. Behind the
scenes, we‚Äôre setting up a few foundational elements to make sure that
contributing to Devtools as a designer is easy. From styling guidelines to UX
principles to Figma documents, we‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre equipped to chip in on
this project. We‚Äôre excited to work with you! In the meantime, we‚Äôd love to hear
from you on [Discord](https://discord.gg/devtools-687207715902193673).
