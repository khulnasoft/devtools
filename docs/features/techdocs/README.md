## What is it?

<!-- Intro, backstory, etc.: -->

TechDocs is Spotifyâ€™s homegrown docs-like-code solution built directly into Devtools. Engineers write their documentation in Markdown files which live together with their code - and with little configuration get a nice-looking doc site in Devtools.

Today, it is one of the core products in Spotifyâ€™s developer experience offering with 5000+ documentation sites and around 10000 average daily hits. Read more about TechDocs in its
[announcement blog post](https://devtools.khulnasoft.com/blog/2020/09/08/announcing-tech-docs).

## Features

- Discover your Service's technical documentation from the Service's page in Devtools Catalog.
- Create documentation-only sites for any purpose by just writing Markdown.
- Take advantage of the [TechDocs Addon Framework](addons.md) to add features on top of the base docs-like-code experience.
- Explore and take advantage of the large ecosystem of
  [MkDocs plugins](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/) to create a rich reading experience.
- Search for and find docs.

## Project roadmap

### Now

No current plans.

### Next

No current plans.

### Someday/Maybe

- What can we do in TechDocs to help drive up documentation quality? We have many ideas, for example, a Trust Card with associated Trust Score and automatic triggering of documentation maintenance notifications.
- Contribute to and deploy from a marketplace of TechDocs Addons
- Addon: MDX (allows you to use JSX in your Markdown content)
- Can we go static site generator agnostic?
- Better integration with
  [Scaffolder V2](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devtools/issues/2771) (e.g. easy to choose and apply documentation template with Software Templates)
- Possible to configure several aspects about TechDocs (e.g. URL, homepage,
  theme)
