The `Cookiecutter.dockerfile` is published to the
[`spotify/devtools-cookiecutter`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/spotify/devtools-cookiecutter)
repository on DockerHub. This is handled by an integration between DockerHub and GitHub.
The integration handles updating the container image when a new release is made.
