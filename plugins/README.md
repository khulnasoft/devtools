# Plugins

Devtools is a single-page application composed of a set of plugins. This folder holds numerous plugins that are managed by this repository. However, most plugins are [in the community plugins repo](https://github.com/khulnasoft/community-plugins) - hop over there if you want to contribute!

For more information about the plugin ecosystem, see the documentation here:

> https://devtools.khulnasoft.com/docs/plugins/

You can also see the [Plugin Marketplace](https://devtools.khulnasoft.com/plugins) for other open source plugins you can add to your Devtools instance.

## Suggesting a plugin

If you start developing a plugin that you aim to release as open source, we suggest that you create a [new Issue on the community plugins repo](https://github.com/khulnasoft/community-plugins/issues/new/choose). This helps the community know what plugins are in development.

You can also use this process if you have an idea for a good plugin but you hope that someone else will pick up the work.
